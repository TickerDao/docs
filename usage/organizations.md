# Organizations

#### Custom Field Display

Token communities can set up their token line item to display up to three custom fields set on your token domain. Token universe is vast and one size does not fit all.

#### Transparent Updates

You no longer have to wait for folks in centralized organizations to review and approve changes to your token data. Go ahead and click the Edit button to submit your content updates on IPFS. TokenDAO will setup incentives to allow TKN stakers to publish such updates immediately. All updates go through pre-defined time-lock periods allowing your entire community to review any changes before they go live.
