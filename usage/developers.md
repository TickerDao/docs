# Developers

#### Query Token Addresses

Fetch the latest deployment of the Uniswap V3 Router contract in your smart contract. Ex: `router.uni.tkn.eth`

#### Clean Decentralized URLs

Resolve decentralized websites from safe and standard URLs. Ex: https://chainlog.mkr.tkn.eth.limo&#x20;

A standard TokenDAO subdomain to resolve the decentralized web apps of your token symbol removes the need for users to find out which ENS domain the token community owns. For example, MakerDAO owns maker.eth and mkr.eth, not makerdao.eth, but will own mkr.tkn.eth forever.
